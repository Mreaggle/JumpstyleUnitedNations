# Oh Shit, Markdown!?

Markdown is deceptively simple: you think you're writing plain text, but suddenly you’re a typographical artist. It’s like you’re painting a masterpiece with a pencil, but instead of paint, it's pure chaos and a sprinkle of magic. Here’s a guide to all the WTF moments you might encounter with Markdown and how to master them with a laugh.

## Oh shit, I want a big, bold heading!

### Headings are your best friend.

Just slap a hash (`#`) in front of your text, and voilà! Instant heading. The more hashes, the smaller the heading. 

```markdown
# H1 - I’m important!
## H2 - Slightly less important
### H3 - Kinda important but not really
```

**Note:** More hashes = less importance. It’s like a backwards popularity contest.

## Oh shit, I want my text to scream at people!

### Making text bold.

When your text needs to shout, **bold** it. Wrap it in double asterisks `**` and unleash the fury.

```markdown
**I’m bold and beautiful!**
```

---

## Oh shit, I want my text to whisper sweet nothings!

### Italics for the win.

For those *soft* moments, when you’re not yelling but still need some flair, italicize it with a single asterisk `*`.

```markdown
*soft whisper*
```

---

## Oh shit, I want to quote something smart!

### Using blockquotes.

When you need to look sophisticated, pretend you’re quoting some ancient wisdom.

```markdown
> "This is a blockquote, so it must be profound." - Someone Important
```

**Note:** Just remember to add a greater-than symbol (`>`) and a space before your text to quote like a pro.

---

## Oh shit, I need to list things out like a boss!

### Ordered and unordered lists.

Got a list? No problem. Use numbers for things in a particular order:

```markdown
1. Get coffee
2. Write code
3. Repeat
```

Or dashes for when order is for suckers:

```markdown
- Wake up
- Contemplate life choices
- Go back to sleep
```

**Note:** Numbers make you look organized. Dashes make you look cool and carefree. Choose wisely.

---

## Oh shit, I need to show some code without breaking everything!

### Inline and fenced code.

For a quick snippet, surround it with backticks `` ` ``:

```markdown
`git commit -m "I swear this time it works"`
```

But for code blocks that are more serious:

```markdown
```
{
  "confused": true,
  "reason": "Too many braces"
}
```
```

**Note:** Triple backticks for code blocks because apparently one just wasn’t enough.

---

## Oh shit, I need to link to something!

### Creating hyperlinks.

Whether it’s a useful resource or a meme, links are your friends.

```markdown
[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)
```

**Note:** Text in square brackets `[]`, URL in parentheses `()`. It’s like tying your shoelaces, but for URLs.

---

## Oh shit, I want to spice things up with an image!

### Inserting images.

Make your documents pop with some visuals. Use an exclamation mark (`!`), then a description in square brackets `[]`, and the image URL in parentheses `()`:

```markdown
![Tux the Penguin](https://www.markdownguide.org/assets/images/tux.png)
```

**Note:** No one can resist the allure of a well-placed penguin.

---

## Oh shit, I want a table, but spreadsheets are for suckers!

### Creating tables.

For when you need to feel like you’re organizing data but don’t want to open Excel:

```markdown
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
```

**Note:** Tables make you look smart. Even if you’re just listing your favorite pizza toppings.

---

## Oh shit, I accidentally struck through my text!

### Using strikethrough.

For those moments when you realize your sarcasm might be a bit too much:

```markdown
~~Sarcasm? Never heard of it.~~
```

**Note:** Just use two tildes `~~` on either side. Perfect for showing how much you’ve grown from your "edgy" phase.

---

## Oh shit, I want to pretend I’m organized!

### Task lists.

Show off your productivity (or lack thereof) with task lists:

```markdown
- [x] Wake up
- [ ] Write an epic novel
- [ ] Save the world
```

**Note:** Checkboxes are more satisfying than actually doing the tasks.

---

## Oh shit, I need to highlight my brilliance!

### Highlighting text.

For those moments when you need to shout, “Look at this, it's important!”

```markdown
I need to highlight these ==very important words==.
```

**Note:** Double equal signs `==` for highlighting. It’s like using a highlighter, but for people who hate actual highlighters.

---

## Oh shit, I want to use emojis, because why not?

### Adding emojis.

Who doesn’t love a good emoji to convey emotions text just can’t?

```markdown
That is so funny! :joy:
```

**Note:** Emojis speak louder than words. Fact.

---

## Oh shit, I’m playing with superpowers!

### Subscript and Superscript.

For when you want to be fancy with your numbers:

Subscript:

```markdown
H~2~O
```

Superscript:

```markdown
X^2^
```

**Note:** Tildes `~` for subscripts, carets `^` for superscripts. Now you’re a Markdown scientist!
