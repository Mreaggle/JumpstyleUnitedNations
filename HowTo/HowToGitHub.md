# Commit your first change

## A commit is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.

> You are now in Quickstart.md file, within github-howto directory, inside JUN repository.

1. Let's take a step back by opening JUN GitHub repository in a new tab, entering 'Jumpstyle Timeline' directory and then commit a change to Global/global-timeline.md by opening Global directory, and editing the '.md' file.
2. In the upper right corner of the file view, click the pencil figure to open the file editor.
3. In the text box, type some information about your experience or knowledge.
4. Above the new content, click Preview to see if it matches your expctations.
5. Review the changes you made to the file by checking Show diff box. You will see the new content in green.
6. Click Commit changes...
7.In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple authors."
8. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "Creating a pull request."

# Next steps
## You have now joined a repository, including a directory with your '.md' file and created your first commit on GitHub.com.

> You can now clone the GitHub repository to create a local copy on your computer. From your local repository you can commit, and create a pull request to update the changes in the upstream repository. For more information, see "Cloning a repository" and "Set up Git."

> You can find interesting projects and repositories on GitHub and make changes to them by creating a fork of the repository. Forking a repository will allow you to make changes to another repository without affecting the original. For more information, see "Fork a repository."
