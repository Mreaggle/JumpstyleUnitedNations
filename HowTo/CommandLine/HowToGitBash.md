# Oh Shit, Git! A Beginner's Guide for Jumpstyle United Nations

Welcome to the "Oh Shit, Git!" guide. This is a beginner-friendly guide to help you navigate Git, a powerful tool used for version control in collaborative projects. If you're a jumper who's never used Git before, don't worry! This guide will help you understand the basics so you can start contributing to the Jumpstyle United Nations projects.

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes in your projects, collaborate with others, and manage multiple versions of files. In the context of Jumpstyle United Nations, Git allows jumpers from around the world to contribute to our shared repository without overwriting each other's work.

## Git Basics for Jumpers

### Getting Started

1. **Install Git**
   - First, you'll need to install Git on your computer. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

2. **Set Up Your Git Profile**
   - Open your command line (Terminal on macOS/Linux, Command Prompt or Git Bash on Windows) and set up your Git profile:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
     ```
   - This information will be used to identify you as the author of your changes.

### Basic Git Commands

Here's a quick overview of essential Git commands to get you started:

1. **Clone a Repository**  
   To start working on a project, you'll need to clone (download) the repository to your computer. For example, to clone the JumpstyleUnitedNations repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/JumpstyleUnitedNations.git
   ```
   
2. **Check the Repository Status**  
   To see which files have been modified or staged for commit:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. **Add Changes**  
   When you modify files and want to include those changes in your next commit, you need to add them:
   ```bash
   git add <file-name>
   ```
   Or, to add all changed files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**  
   Once you've added your changes, you need to commit them to save a snapshot of your current work:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
   ```

5. **Push Changes**  
   To share your changes with others, you'll need to push them to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   Make sure to replace `main` with the name of the branch you are working on if it's different.

6. **Pull Changes**  
   To update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository, use:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Troubleshooting Common Git Issues

- **"Oh Shit, I Made a Mistake!"**  
  Don't worry! If you make a mistake, you can always undo your last commit (as long as you haven't pushed it yet):
  ```bash
  git reset HEAD~1
  ```

- **"Oh Shit, I Committed to the Wrong Branch!"**  
  You can move your commit to the correct branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout correct-branch
  git cherry-pick commit-sha
  ```

- **"Oh Shit, There's a Merge Conflict!"**  
  A merge conflict happens when two changes affect the same part of a file. To resolve it:
  1. Open the conflicting file and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
  2. Edit the file to resolve the conflicts.
  3. Add the resolved file:
     ```bash
     git add <file-name>
     ```
  4. Commit the merge:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
     ```
