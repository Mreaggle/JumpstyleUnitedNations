# Oh Shit, GitHub Through PC Browser!?

Welcome, mobile Jumpers! You’ve decided to contribute to GitHub using just your PC browser—props to you for being that agile! Whether you’re adding the latest Jumpstyle tutorial while waiting for a train or fixing a typo between dance sessions, you’re in the right place. Let's get you moving and grooving on GitHub using just your PC browser!

## Oh Shit, What Do I Need?

Before we jump right in, here’s what you need to get started:

1. **A SmartPC**: Obviously! iPC, Android, or even a Nokia 3310 if you've somehow modded it to have a browser (major respect if you have).
2. **A GitHub Account**: If you don’t have one yet, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up. It’s like getting backstage access at a Jumpstyle event.
3. **A Stable Internet Connection**: Because nobody likes lag—especially not in a jump battle or when committing to GitHub.

## Oh Shit, Let’s Get Started!

Time to get those thumbs working and jump into GitHub via your PC browser!

### Step 1: Open GitHub in Your Browser

- Open your favorite web browser on your PC (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or whatever else you’re using).
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com). You should see the GitHub homepage ready to welcome you.

### Step 2: Sign In or Create an Account

- If you already have an account, tap **“Sign in”** at the top right corner and enter your credentials.
- If you’re new to GitHub, tap **“Sign up”** and follow the steps to create your account. Don’t worry, it’s as easy as learning the basic Jump!

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Repository

- Once you’re signed in, tap on the **hamburger menu** (those three little lines in the upper left corner) to open the main menu.
- Go to **“Your repositories”** to see all the repositories you own or contribute to. 
- Tap on the repository you want to work on. It’s like choosing which Jumpstyle track to dance to!

### Step 4: Edit a File

Oh shit, want to make some changes directly on your PC? Easy peasy!

- Navigate to the file you want to edit. Just tap through the folders like you’re digging through your playlist for the perfect track.
- Once you find the file, tap on it. Then, tap the **pencil icon** (✏️) at the top right to enter edit mode.
- Make your changes using your PC keyboard. Fix that typo, add that move description, or update your Jumpstyle tutorial—whatever you need!

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes

- After making your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
- You’ll see a **“Commit changes”** section. Enter a commit message describing what you changed, like “Updated Jumpstyle tutorial with new spins” (or something equally awesome).
- Tap **“Commit changes”** and voilà—your changes are now saved!

### Step 6: Create a New File

Want to add a brand new file to the repository? No problem!

- Go to the repository's main page and tap **“Add file”** > **“Create new file”**.
- Enter a name for your new file and type in your content. Maybe you’re adding a new README for a Jumpstyle challenge or uploading a choreography guide.
- Once you’re done, add a commit message and tap **“Commit new file”**.

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

If you’re making changes that need to be reviewed or you’re contributing to someone else’s project, you’ll want to create a pull request.

- Go back to the main page of the repository.
- Tap on the **“Pull requests”** tab and then the **“New pull request”** button.
- Review your changes, add a title and description for your pull request, and tap **“Create pull request”**.
- Boom! Your pull request is live, and your contributions are ready to be reviewed!

## Oh Shit, Need Some Help?

Jumping into GitHub using a PC browser can be a bit tricky at first, but don’t worry—you’re not alone! If you get stuck, ask for help in the Jumpstyle community or check out the [GitHub Mobile Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en). Everyone started somewhere, even the pros!

## Oh Shit, You’re a Mobile GitHub Pro Now!

Congratulations, you just contributed to GitHub using only your PC! Whether you’re adding content from the dance floor or the back of a bus, you’re now a true multi-tasking jumper. Keep contributing, keep jumping, and most importantly—keep having fun!

*P.S.: If you ever find yourself frustrated or stuck, just remember: GitHub is like a Jumpstyle routine. It’s all about rhythm, timing, and a little bit of flair. Happy contributing, jumper!* 🎶📱
