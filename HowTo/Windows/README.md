## 🪟[Windows App](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32?format=msi)

Welcome, Jumpers! You’ve decided to dive into the magical world of GitHub using the Windows app. Fantastic choice! Whether you're contributing your first tutorial on how to nail that Yakuza Kick or just uploading a video of your new moves, we’re here to help you jump right into GitHub like a pro. Let’s get started and make your contributions smooth and stylish—just like your dance moves!

## Oh Shit, What Do I Need?

Before we start, let's make sure you've got everything you need:

1. **A Windows Computer**: Duh! You need a trusty PC to install the GitHub Desktop app.
2. **GitHub Account**: If you don’t have one yet, go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up. It’s like getting your membership card to the coolest club around.
3. **GitHub Desktop App**: Download it from [here](https://desktop.github.com/). It’s the app that will make your life a hundred times easier—like a jumpstyle playlist on repeat!

## Oh Shit, Let’s Get Started!

Once you’ve got all the essentials, it’s time to jump right into the action!

### Step 1: Install GitHub Desktop

- Go to the GitHub Desktop download page and click that shiny **"Download for Windows"** button. 
- Open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Don’t worry, it’s easier than learning a new combo move!

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Desktop

- Launch GitHub Desktop once it’s installed. You should see a welcome screen that’s almost as inviting as a Jumpstyle party.
- Sign in with your GitHub account. If you skipped creating an account earlier, now’s your chance. Just click **“Sign in to GitHub.com”** and follow the prompts.

### Step 3: Clone a Repository

Oh shit, you want to start working on something? First, you need to clone a repository to your local machine. It’s like downloading the dance routine you’re going to learn.

- Click **“File”** in the top menu and select **“Clone Repository”**.
- Choose a repository you want to work on from your GitHub account or enter the URL of the repo.
- Select a local path where you want to clone the repository (pick a spot where you can easily find it, like your `Documents` folder).
- Click **“Clone”** and let the magic happen!

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

Now it’s time to get creative! Open the cloned repository folder and start making your changes. Add your jumpstyle tutorials, choreography guides, or any other awesome content you want to share with the community.

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes

Oh shit, changes made? Time to commit them!

- Go back to GitHub Desktop. You should see all your changes listed in the **“Changes”** tab.
- Review your changes to make sure everything is ready. No one wants to commit mistakes like forgetting to add a “jump” in the jumpstyle guide!
- Write a meaningful commit message in the **“Summary”** box. Something like “Added new tutorial on Jumpstyle spins” works great.
- Click **“Commit to main”** (or your current branch name) to save your changes.

### Step 6: Push Your Changes

Now that your changes are committed locally, it's time to push them to GitHub so everyone can see your sweet moves!

- Click the **“Push Origin”** button in the top menu of GitHub Desktop.
- Your changes are now live on GitHub! 🎉

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

If you’re contributing to a project, you’ll want to create a pull request so your changes can be reviewed and added to the main project.

- Go to your repository on GitHub (just click **“View on GitHub”** in GitHub Desktop).
- Click the **“Pull Requests”** tab, then **“New Pull Request”**.
- Add a title and description for your pull request, then click **“Create Pull Request”**.
- Now you just sit back and wait for your awesome contributions to be reviewed!

## Oh Shit, Need Some Help?

Getting stuck is part of the process—just like landing your first Jumpstyle move. If you’re facing issues or have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to fellow jumpers in the community or check out the [GitHub Desktop Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop).

## Oh Shit, You’re a GitHub Pro Now!

And there you have it! You’ve made your first GitHub contribution using the Windows app. Keep practicing, keep jumping, and keep contributing. The Jumpstyle GitHub community is pumped to see what you bring to the dance floor.

*Remember: GitHub is like a jumpstyle battle. It’s all about learning new moves, sharing with the community, and having a blast! Welcome to the GitHub dance floor, jumper!* 🎶👟
