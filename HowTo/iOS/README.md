# Oh Shit, GitHub Through the iPhone App!?

## 📱[iOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905)

Alright Jumpers, you’ve decided to bring your Jumpstyle game to GitHub through your iPhone. You’re about to merge your dance moves with tech on-the-go. Whether you’re tweaking choreo in the airport or reviewing code in the middle of a dance battle, the GitHub iPhone app has got you covered. Here’s how to jump in and start contributing like a pro!

## Oh Shit, What Do I Need?

Before we start, let’s make sure you’re prepped and ready to rumble:

1. **An iPhone**: You know, the magical rectangle in your pocket that lets you text, tweet, and take epic dance videos.
2. **GitHub App**: Grab the GitHub app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905). It’s like having the whole GitHub universe in your pocket!
3. **A GitHub Account**: If you don’t have one yet, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up. It’s your ticket to contribute to the Jumpstyle community!

## Oh Shit, Let’s Get Started!

Let’s get you set up on GitHub using the iPhone app so you can jump right into action.

### Step 1: Install the GitHub App

First things first, you need the GitHub app. Go to the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905) and download it. Open it up once it’s installed.

### Step 2: Log Into Your GitHub Account

- Open the app and tap **“Sign In.”**
- Enter your GitHub username and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled (which you totally should, for security!), you’ll need to enter that code too.
  
Boom! You’re in.

### Step 3: Find a Repository

Alright, time to find the repo you want to contribute to. You can browse through your own repositories, your starred repositories, or search for any repository on GitHub.

- Tap the **“Search”** icon at the bottom of the screen and type in the repository name.
- Once you find it, tap on the repository to open it.

### Step 4: Fork the Repository

Oh shit, you want to make changes? You’ll need to fork the repository first. This means you’re creating your own copy of the repo to work on.

- In the repository view, tap the **“Fork”** button at the top right corner.
- The app will create a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account. You’re now ready to make some moves!

### Step 5: Make Your Changes

Okay, this is where the magic happens. To make changes directly in the app:

- Tap on any file in the repository to open it.
- Tap the **“...”** icon at the top right and select **“Edit File.”**
- Now, go ahead and make your changes! You can add new steps to a tutorial, fix a typo, or whatever needs doing.
  
### Step 6: Commit Your Changes

Got your changes in? Time to save them!

- Once you’ve made your edits, tap **“Commit Changes”** at the top right.
- Enter a commit message describing what you did. Keep it short, sweet, and to the point, like: “Updated jump tutorial for better flow.”
- Tap **“Commit Changes”** again to save. That’s it! Your changes are now committed to your forked repository.

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

You’ve got your changes committed, now it’s time to get them into the main repository.

- Tap the **“Pull Requests”** tab at the bottom of the screen.
- Tap **“New Pull Request.”**
- Select the base repository (the original one) and compare it with your fork.
- Review your changes and tap **“Create Pull Request.”**
- Add a title and a description for your pull request, then tap **“Create.”**

And just like that, you’ve submitted your changes! Now, the repository maintainers can review and merge your awesome updates.
