Welcome to the "Oh Shit, GitHub on PC Browsers!" guide. This humorous and beginner-friendly guide will help you navigate GitHub using your PC browser so you can contribute to Jumpstyle United Nations projects without losing your mind. 😅

## What is GitHub? 🤔

GitHub is like the social media platform for developers. It hosts code repositories and lets us collaborate on cool projects. 🛠️ Think of it as a digital dance floor where code and creativity meet!

## Getting Started on GitHub from Your PC Browser

### 1. Accessing GitHub 🚀

- **Open GitHub**: Launch your favorite browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or whatever floats your boat) and go to [GitHub](https://github.com). Log in with your GitHub account or [sign up](https://github.com/join) if you’re new. 🎉
- **Find the JUN Repository**: Use the search bar or click [here](https://github.com/JumpstyleUnitedNations) to go directly to our repository. 🌍

### 2. Basic GitHub Actions on a PC Browser 🖱️

#### View Repository Content 📂

- **Browse Files**: Click on the repo name to see a list of files and directories. It’s like browsing through a digital filing cabinet. 📁
- **View Files**: Click on a file name to view its contents. It’s like opening a folder but without the paper cuts. 📄

#### Edit Files ✏️

- **Navigate to the File**: Click on the file you want to edit. Don’t worry; no need to put on your dancing shoes for this! 👟
- **Edit Button**: Hit the pencil icon (✏️) at the top right to enter the editor. Feel free to strut your stuff here. 💃
- **Make Changes**: Edit the file in the editor. If it’s a Markdown file like `nation-timeline.md`, use Markdown syntax to add some flair. 📝
- **Commit Changes**: Click “Commit changes,” write a commit message (like a shoutout to your dance crew), and click “Commit changes” again. 🆙

#### Create New Files 📄

- **Navigate to the Directory**: Go to the folder where you want to add a new file. Think of it as finding the perfect spot on the dance floor. 🕺
- **Create File**: Click “Add file” and select “Create new file.” Name it and add content like you’re picking the perfect track for your set. 🎵
- **Commit**: Write a commit message and click “Commit new file.” Nailed it! 🙌

#### Create a Pull Request 🔄

- **Fork the Repository**: If you don’t have write access, click “Fork” at the top right. It’s like taking a dance move and making it your own. 🍴
- **Make Changes**: Follow the steps above to edit files in your forked repo. Get creative! 🎨
- **Create Pull Request**: Go back to the main repo, click “Pull requests,” then “New pull request.” Select your fork and branch, then follow the prompts. Show us what you’ve got! 🎤

#### Review and Comment on Pull Requests 🧐
