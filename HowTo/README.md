## Oh Shit, What Do I Do?

Before you start freaking out about commands, branches, and commits, let's get you set up on the platform of your choice. We’ve got guides for almost everything. Choose your weapon wisely:

### Oh Shit, I’m On Linux!

If you’re a penguin-loving, terminal-tapping jumper, check out our Linux guide. It’s perfect for those who enjoy typing mysterious commands and pretending they’re hacking into the Matrix.

- [Linux Guide](./Linux)

### Oh Shit, I’m Using Windows!

If you're more into clicking and less into command-lining, our Windows guide is coming soon. Hang tight!

- [Windows Guide](./Windows)

### Oh Shit, I’m On My Phone Web Browser!

On the go and need to contribute between jumps? No worries, we’ve got a guide for mobile web browsers too! Just don’t code while you’re doing the Running Man, okay?

- [Phone Web Browser Guide](./Browser/Phone)

### Oh Shit, I’m Using My PC Web Browser!

For those who like the comfort of a full-sized screen but don’t want to mess with installing stuff, our PC Web Browser guide will get you contributing in no time.

- [PC Web Browser Guide](./Browser/PC)

### Oh Shit, I’m On iOS!

Apple fans, rejoice! Your guide is also coming soon. Sit tight and don’t break your screen doing the Side Jump!

- [iOS Guide](./iOS)

### Oh Shit, I’m On MacOS!

For those who’ve mastered the art of the Command key, a MacOS guide is in the works. Until then, keep jamming on your Mac!

## Oh Shit, I Need To Learn GitHub Basics!

If all this talk about GitHub has you scratching your head, don’t worry. Just like mastering the oldschool basics, it’s all about practice. Check out our guides by choosing the Platform you're just using under the [**HowToGitHub**](./Browser/HowToGitHub.md) section to get started. We promise, no jumpscares or 'Panico' here (well, maybe a few when you see a merge conflict).

## Oh Shit, I Want To Learn Markdown Typing!

Markdown is like the choreography of documentation. It’s how we make things pretty and readable. Head over to our [**HowToMarkdownTyping**](./Browser/HowToMarkdownTyping.md) section to learn how to format like a boss. Whether you're typing out your first README or crafting an epic tutorial, Markdown will make your words dance on the page.

## Oh Shit, I’m Ready To Jump In!

Once you’ve got the platform guide down, it’s time to contribute. Just remember: GitHub is your dance floor, and your code is the beat. Keep it tight, keep it clean, and always commit with style!

So, pick your guide, follow the steps, and let’s see you make some noise in this repository! 

Remember, every jumper started with a small step, or in our case, a small commit. United jumping, coding, and contributing!

*P.S.: If you get stuck or need help, don’t panic. Just think of it as missing a beat in your WJL final solo. Head over to the nearest guide or hit up a fellow jumper over JUN for some advice. We’ve all been there, and we’ve all faceplanted at least once. Welcome to the JUN GitHub!*
