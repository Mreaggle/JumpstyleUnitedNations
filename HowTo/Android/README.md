# Oh Shit, GitHub Through the Android App!?

Alright, Jumpers! You’re ready to bring your Jumpstyle skills to GitHub using your Android phone. Whether you're tweaking some code between dance sessions or fixing a README while waiting for your next jump battle, the GitHub Android app has your back. Here’s how to get started on your mobile and jump into the world of contributions!

## Oh Shit, What Do I Need?

Before we get this party started, make sure you have the essentials:

1. **An Android Phone**: The mini computer that’s always with you (and probably also your Jumpstyle music player).
2. **GitHub App**: Grab the GitHub app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android). It’s like having GitHub in your pocket!
3. **A GitHub Account**: If you haven’t already, sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com). It’s your golden ticket to contribute to the Jumpstyle community!

## Oh Shit, Let’s Get Started!

Let’s walk through setting up and using the GitHub app on your Android device, so you can start contributing on-the-go!

### Step 1: Install the GitHub App

First, download the GitHub app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android). Once it’s installed, open it up and get ready to dive in.

### Step 2: Log Into Your GitHub Account

- Open the GitHub app and tap **“Sign In.”**
- Enter your GitHub username and password. If you’ve enabled two-factor authentication (you should—it’s like having double locks on your front door), you’ll need to enter that code too.

Boom! You’re in and ready to go!

### Step 3: Find a Repository

Alright, time to find the repository you want to contribute to. You can browse your repositories, those you’ve starred, or search for any public repository.

- Tap the **“Search”** icon at the bottom and type in the repository name.
- Once you find it, tap on it to open the repository.

### Step 4: Fork the Repository

So, you want to make some changes? First, you’ll need to fork the repository, which creates a copy of it in your own GitHub account.

- In the repository view, tap the **“Fork”** button (usually near the top right).
- The app will make a copy of the repository in your account. This is your own playground to make changes!

### Step 5: Make Your Changes

Let’s get those changes rolling. Here’s how to do it directly in the app:

- Tap on any file in the repository to open it.
- Tap the **“…”** (three dots) icon at the top right and select **“Edit File.”**
- Go ahead and make your changes. Maybe you’re updating a dance move in a tutorial, fixing a typo, or adding some awesome new content.

### Step 6: Commit Your Changes

Got your changes just right? Time to save them!

- Once your edits are done, tap **“Commit changes”** at the top right.
- Enter a commit message that describes what you’ve done. Keep it simple, like: “Updated tutorial for smoother steps.”
- Tap **“Commit changes”** again to save. And just like that, your changes are committed to your forked repository!

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

You’ve committed your changes, now it’s time to propose merging them into the original repository.

- Tap the **“Pull Requests”** tab at the bottom.
- Tap **“Create Pull Request.”**
- Select the base repository (the original one) and compare it with your fork.
- Review your changes and tap **“Create Pull Request.”**
- Add a title and a description for your pull request, then tap **“Create.”**

And you’re done! You’ve submitted a pull request for your changes. Now it’s up to the repository maintainers to review and (hopefully) merge your awesome contributions.

## Oh Shit, Need Some Help?

Don’t worry if you stumble. Learning GitHub on your Android is like learning a new Jumpstyle move—it takes some practice. If you run into trouble, check out the [GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/en) or ask your fellow Jumpers for a hand!

## Oh Shit, You’re an Android GitHub Pro!
