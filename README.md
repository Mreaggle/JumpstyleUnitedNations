# 🤔 What is GitHub?

## GitHub is an online platform where you can collaborate in projects worldwide through text file management.
>[Read HowTo/ files for a quick tutorial and start typing.](https://github.com/Mreaggle/JumpstyleUnitedNations/blob/main/HowTo/)


**⚙️ JUN GitHub rules:**

```
 🌐 - All Nations can add to Global
 🏳️ - A Nation can add to itself
 ⛔️ - A Nation cannot add to another nation without permission.
```

Think of GitHub as a digital library where everyone can edit and improve files in their own sections. For projects like 'TheJumpstyleTimeline' within the repository, each Nation has its own directory, you can update your nation's history and also add them to the Global. By this way, different perspectives on each nation, sum to feed a huge time-oriented file fulfilled of granular information from every single nation that experienced and stills experiencing jumpstyle phenomenon.

**😒 Will it mess with my routine?**

No need to worry about pausing your personal life tasks! This project is entirely voluntary. You can contribute as much or as little as you like, and you can step down whenever you want. Your participation is based on your interest and availability.

**🪛 How will this work in practice?**

You’ll be working within your Nation's directory/folder, adding and editing information among other people from your Nation, sharing knowledge and experiences on Jumpstyle history (you can only add to another Nation if authorized by it's keepers).
You can also contribute to the Global folder if you want to share something with everyone, this one has no limitations.

**🧑‍⚖️ Individual Rules:**

- _Do not offend, nor act in disrespectful way._
- _Do not share contacts without permission._
- _Do not profit over JUN content, use it as an advisor instead._
- _Do not mess the repository, you don't even have reasons for such thing._
