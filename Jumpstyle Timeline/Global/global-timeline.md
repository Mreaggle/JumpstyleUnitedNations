### Undeground/Clubber/Skïen Era

#### 1991 🇳🇱 🇧🇪 : 
>"Jump" is a new music genre in Belgium (mainly Antwerp and Lokeren), born as an alternative to Dutch "Hardcore/Gabber" scene, mixing it with another similar genre: the Spanish "Makina" and some Belgium "New-Beat" elements. The purpose is to take out the speed of hardcore and make it cooler for non-hard-dance enjoyers (note: Hakken means Chopping (slicing) as Jumpen means Jumping, in Dutch language).
