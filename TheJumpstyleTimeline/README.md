# JumpstyleTimeline/Key/Figures

🤙 **What is this?** 🤙

This directory is dedicated to storing information about Jumpstyle's key figures. This way we can remember everyone who made Jumpstyle what it is today, from the early days to the present. We're building a sick timeline here, and every jumper deserves to be remembered!

🤘 **How to contribute?** 🤘

It's easier than doing a perfect base! Just create a markdown file for each jumper, following this structure:

```
# [Jumper Name] ([Country Code] [Year Active])

[Image or GIF of the jumper]

## About [Jumper Name]

[Write a brief description of the jumper, their style, and why they are relevant to Jumpstyle history. You can talk about their achievements, impact on the community, or any remarkable facts.]

## Sickest Moves

* [List some of their signature moves or tricks.]

## Check them out!

* [YouTube Channel]
* [Other relevant links] 

```
